# sass-boilerplate

### Description

This is a Sass boilerplate made up from several different existing boilerplates, adapted and adjusted according to my own real world needs. This is how I start every project where I use Sass.

### app.scss
The main file named `app.scss` should be the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore. This file should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.
