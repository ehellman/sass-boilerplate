# Base

The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In there, you might find some typographic rules, and probably a stylesheet (that Iâ€™m used to calling `_base.scss`), defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements.

- `_base.scss`
- `_reset.scss`
- `_typography.scss`

> If your project uses a lot of CSS animations, you might consider adding an `\_animations.scss` file in there containing the `@keyframes` definitions of all your animations. If you only use a them sporadically, let them live along the selectors that use them.
